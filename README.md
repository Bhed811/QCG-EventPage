#QCG EVENT PAGE
I have tried to create the event page for the QCG website with its overall design aligning with that of the official QCG WEBSITE and also used my creativty to make it unique and interactive
I have added the feature of scrollToTopButton and navBarColourChange features like that in the official page
I have created a json file and stored the details of all the events there and then fetched those details. So, if any new event is to be added, it can be simply added in the json file.
