#QCG EVENT PAGE


I have dedicated efforts to meticulously craft the event page for the QCG website, ensuring a seamless alignment with the overarching design principles of the official QCG website. My approach has not only embraced the established aesthetic but has also been infused with a touch of creativity, rendering the page a unique and interactive experience.

Interactive Enhancements:

scrollToTopButton: A thoughtful addition that allows users to effortlessly navigate back to the top of the page, enhancing overall user experience.

navBarColourChange: The navigation bar dynamically changes color, mirroring features present on the official page. This not only adds a visually appealing touch but also contributes to a more engaging user interaction.

Efficient Content Management:

I've implemented a robust solution by creating a JSON file to store comprehensive details of all events.

The dynamic fetching of details from the JSON file ensures a streamlined process for updating and adding new events. If there's a new event to be featured, it can be seamlessly incorporated by adding the relevant details to the JSON file.
